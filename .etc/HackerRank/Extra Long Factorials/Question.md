# HackerRank 'Forming a Magic Square'

<br>

## 문제
The factorial of the integer n, written n!, is defined as:

n! = n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if n = 30, we calculate 30 x 29 x 28 x ... x 2 x 1 and get 26525285981219105763630848000000.

## 기능 설명
Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.

extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):

- n: an integer

<br><br>

## Note
Factorials of n > 20 can't be stored even in a 64-bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.
